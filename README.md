Objective - To create a community- like collaborative environment mainly targeted towards apartments and housing societies, with the following features:
1. Security authentication through OTP - Detects when a guest is within the  vicinity of the gate and automatically generates an OTP. This allows for contactless verification and entry.
2. An important news and notifications message board
3. A community marketplace for apartment members wherein services or second-hand products can be sold
4. Facilitates booking slots in the gym, badminton court, basketball court, etc. in advance in the light of Covid- mandated social distancing and avoidance of crowds

In the future, we are looking to implement these features:
1. To better understand if a product ( like jewellery, shoes etc. ) suits the customer, an AR feature to enable virtual try-on of products.
2. Using an OpenCV authentication system through which hand gestures can be detected for the verification of a guest.</br>
3.SafeProtect : Create a trust system ( of a few people who you trust your child with ) and monitor if child is in contact with them only ( on a bus or otherwise ). For others, safe distance of 6 feet must be kept.</br>
The above social distancing system is also created using OpenCV.</br>
4.Sentiment analysis to get feedback from apt members of featured services so that better rated and reviewed services appear more highly recommended.
